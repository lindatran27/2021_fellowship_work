# MEDIUM: Create a program that accepts a number (1-12) as input and logs to the console that number and its corresponding month. 
# For example: if the user enters the number 3, then it should return the month “March.” 
# Alert the user if they enter an invalid number (e.g. less than 1 or greater than 12).
number = input("input a number: ")
